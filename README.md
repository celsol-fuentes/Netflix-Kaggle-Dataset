# Netflix-Kaggle-Dataset
In the first iteration of Project 1 with the Nextflix dataset,
I have done some data exploration and visualization.
Then I move on to concentrating on South America,
where the top three directors worked mainly in Stand-up and TV-MA movies.

Project_1_Netflix_Data_Celia_Fuentes:
- uploading Kaggle dataset on Colab
- Exploration, Cleaning an Visualization
- Focused on South America for certain question

Updated_Project_1_Netflix_Data_Celia_Fuentes:
In this updated Project 1, I have scraped two datasets from imdb
and have added them to make one huge dataset with the Netflix data. 
I provide new visualization, and attempt a simple machine learning algorithm
to attempt to predict the class of rating the movie/tv show belongs to.
